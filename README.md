# Trading Dashboard

A comprehensive Angular-based trading performance dashboard for tracking and analyzing trading contracts with profit/loss visualization. This application helps traders monitor their regular and NIFTY contract performances with an intuitive interface.

## Features

### 📊 Dual Interface
- **Input Data Tab**: Add trading contracts manually or via Excel import
- **Dashboard Tab**: Visualize performance metrics and analytics

### 📝 Data Entry Options
- **Manual Entry**: Add individual contracts with month/year, contract name, type (Regular/NIFTY), and P&L
- **Excel Import**: Bulk upload contracts using Excel files (2-column format: Symbol, Realized P&L)
- **Auto Type Detection**: Contract type automatically inferred from symbol name (NIFTY symbols detected automatically)
- **Template Download**: Get a pre-formatted Excel template for easy data entry

### 📈 Dashboard Analytics
- **Overall Realized P&L**: Compact display of total profit/loss
- **Major Profit Contributors**: Top 12 profitable regular contracts
- **Major Loss Contributors**: Top 12 loss-making regular contracts
- **NIFTY Futures Performance**: Consolidated P&L with top movers
- **NIFTY Options Performance**: Consolidated P&L with top movers
### 🚀 V2 Dashboard (Experimental)
- Compact performance snapshot with initial metrics
- Advanced analytics foundation: max drawdown, win/loss streaks
- Lightweight equity curve sparkline (placeholder)

#### Metrics, Calculations & Usefulness
- **Net P&L**: Sum of all `pnl`. Positive → net profit; negative → net loss.
- **Total Trades**: Count of loaded contracts.
- **Winning Trades**: Count where `pnl > 0`.
- **Losing Trades**: Count where `pnl < 0`.
- **Win Rate (%)**: `(Winning Trades / Total Trades) * 100`. Gauges consistency.
- **Average Win (₹)**: `Sum(pnl > 0) / Winning Trades`. Typical profitable trade size.
- **Average Loss (₹)**: `Abs(Sum(pnl < 0)) / Losing Trades`. Typical losing trade size.
- **Profit Factor**: `Sum(pnl > 0) / Abs(Sum(pnl < 0))`. >1 indicates quality of returns vs losses.
- **Max Drawdown (₹)**: Max peak-to-trough decline of cumulative P&L. Critical for risk tolerance.
- **Longest Win Streak**: Max consecutive `pnl > 0`. Signals positive momentum.
- **Longest Loss Streak**: Max consecutive `pnl < 0`. Highlights risk of tilt/regime shift.

#### Equity Curve Sparkline (Placeholder)
- Built from the cumulative sum of `pnl`, normalized to fit a compact visual. Intended as a stopgap before full charting.

See `docs/dashboardv2.md` for the full V2 roadmap and design.
- **Monthly Summary**: Concise overview of total profit, loss, and net P&L

### 💡 Key Capabilities
- Real-time P&L calculations
- Color-coded profit/loss indicators
- Contract type differentiation (Regular vs NIFTY)
- Month-wise tracking
- Delete individual contracts
- Clear all data functionality

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Angular 21.0.0
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.9.2
- **Build Tool**: Angular CLI 21.0.1
- **Testing**: Vitest 4.0.8
- **Excel Processing**: XLSX library
- **Styling**: Component-scoped CSS with gradient effects

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm 11.6.2 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd trading-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Development

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm start
# or
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload when you modify source files.

### Code Scaffolding

Generate new components using Angular CLI:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For available schematics:
```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
ng build
```

Build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory with optimizations for performance.

### Watch Mode

Build in watch mode for development:
```bash
npm run watch
```

## Testing

Run unit tests using Vitest:

```bash
npm test
# or
ng test
```

## Excel File Format

When importing data via Excel, use the following simplified format:

| Column A | Column B |
|----------|----------|
| Symbol | Realized P&L |
| WIPRO25DECFUT | 18600 |
| NIFTY25N112450PE | -7946.25 |
| KAYNES25DECFUT | 7500 |

- **Column A**: Symbol/Contract name (e.g., WIPRO25DECFUT, NIFTY25N112450PE)
- **Column B**: Realized P&L amount (positive for profit, negative for loss)

**Note**: Contract type (Regular/NIFTY) is automatically detected from the symbol name. If the symbol contains "NIFTY" (case-insensitive), it's classified as a NIFTY contract; otherwise, it's classified as Regular.

Download the template from the application for the correct format.
